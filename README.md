This is a Java console-based Rock Paper Scissors game where a human player plays against the computer. 
The project is developed using object-oriented programming concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
The game has three move classes (Rock, Paper, Scissors) that extend an abstract Move class.
There are two types of players: HumanPlayer, which takes input from the user, and ComputerPlayer, which generates random moves.
The RockPaperScissorsGame class manages the game flow, handles multiple rounds, keeps track of scores, and announces the winner.
The game runs in the console, allowing the user to choose moves, view results of each round, and decide whether to play again.
It follows a “best of N rounds” format (default is 3 rounds).
This project demonstrates the use of Java classes, inheritance, method overriding, encapsulation, and user input handling while creating an interactive and fun game.
